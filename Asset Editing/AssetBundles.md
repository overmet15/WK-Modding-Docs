# AssetBundle
Is a class. Thats all lmfao.  
Official Documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.3/Documentation/Manual/AssetBundlesIntro.html

Ok jk jk.

## Why?
Asset bundle can contain assets like textures, fonts, sounds, materials, prefabs, models, or scene, which you can then export into game without modifying the game's files.

## How?
So, Asset Bundle is a class __and__ file.  
Using unity version that is noted in [Info](https://github.com/overmet15/WK-Modding-Docs/blob/main/Info.md), you can build your own asset bundles.  
Note that you will need editor script for that, it should be aviable soon.

So, using [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) you need to [click this](unityhub://2022.3.32f1) to get the unity version from archive.

With that unity version, you should be able to build Asset Bundle's compabiable with White Knuckle.

## Retardation
There are 2 types of asset bundles, assets and scene

You cant have multiple scenes, or scene with the assets in same bundle, f#cking retardation...
