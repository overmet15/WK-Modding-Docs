# AssetBundle
Is a class. Thats all lmfao.

Ok jk jk.

So, AB is a class __and__ file.  
Using unity version that is noted in [Info](https://github.com/overmet15/WK-Modding-Docs/blob/main/Info.md), you can build your own asset bundles.  
Note that you will need editor script for that, it should be aviable soon.

So, using [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) you need to [click this](unityhub://2022.3.32f1) to get the unity version from archive.
